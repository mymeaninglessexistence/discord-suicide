# discord suicide

ever attempted suicide and wanted to say bye to your friends on discord or let them know it's not their fault after ur death? yes, i know very common use case lmao

# how to use
1. put ur token in .env [how to get ur token](https://gist.github.com/MarvNC/e601f3603df22f36ebd3102c501116c6)
2. enter the date and time you want the messages to be sent (after ur death, obviously)
3. in the config.json file the "generalMessage" will be sent to everyone, even the people where you have only entered a personalized message. people in "additionalUsers" will only receive the general message
4. run it on a vps or something that won't get shutdown
5. kill urself :)

oh you can also use this for other purposes ofc, i just made it for that reason
