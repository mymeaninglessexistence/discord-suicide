        "1234567891011121317": "uhhh yeah. u said 'i don't know what makes me avoid suicide', well i don't know either lmao. some lifes are simply not worth living sadly. u were always a great friend, u have a great humor and u're extreamly smart. u deserve the best bro, maybe we can play some more rumbleverse in the afterlife xD",
